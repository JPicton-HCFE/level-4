      <p>
        Before I continue with the features and applications of the <a href="#data-protection-act">DPA (Data Protection
          Act)</a> and GDPR (General DataProtection Regulation), there are links below for the official legislation
        regarding these two regulations.

      <h2 id="data-protection-act">Data Protection Act</h2>
      <p>
        Starting with the DPA, this legilsation was introduced in 2018 (23-05-2018), this legislation controls how
        organisations (both businesses and government departments) can use your personal data. As seen earlier the DPA
        came into action in May of 2018, this was alongside the <a href="#"></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Below I will be looking at the features and applications of the DPA for organisations.

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>
        There are seven main principles for the DPA that organisations must adhere to when operating within the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="info-start">1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency</span> - This requires organisations to
        process data within a way that is lawful, fair, and transparent. They need to clearly state and provide the user
        the information on how their data will be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="info-start">2. Purpose Limitation</span> - This asks organisations to collect data for specified,
        explicit or legitimate purposes and not to further process this data in an incompatible way with those purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="info-start">3. Minimisation</span> - This is to ensure that organisations only collect data
        relevant to the specified intended purpose, or at least should be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="info-start">4. Accuracy</span> - Organisations should have the most up to date information/data
        otherwise the outdated data should be rectified or deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="info-start">5. Storage Limitation</span> - When organisations collect data, they should hold that
        data for no longer than it's intended use. They should have clear retention policies, whilst also dispose of any
        data that is no longer redeemed necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="info-start">6. Integrity and Confidentiality</span> - With the collected data, organisations must
        process the personal data within a secure manner. They must protect against accidental loss, destruction or
        damage to the data. Some security measures they could use, include encryption and anonymisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="info-start">7. Accountability</span> - When handling the data, the data controller (the person who
        determines the purpose(s) and means of processing of personal data), must take responsibility in how they handle
        personal data. They must also be able to demonstrate compliance with the DPA (2018).
