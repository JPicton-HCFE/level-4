    Combines traditonal firewall functions with advacned security features. Intrusion, prevetntion, application
    awareness, and threat intelligence.
    NGFWs inspect networking traffic at layer 7 of OSI. It has it's overheads (cons) like costs and time (processing).

    Traditional vs NGFWs
    Traditional primarly focus on basic network security by filtering traffic based on IP addresses and port numbers att
    the transport layer (layer 4).

        Forward vs Reverse Proxy
        <section>
          Forward (outward traffic) Proxy (server) A forward proxy sits in front of clients and acts as an intermediart
          between a user and the internet.
          <section>
            Privacy / Anonymity: Masks the clients IP address.
            Access Control: Enforce policies (e.g. blocking sites)
            Caching: Stores frequently accessed content to reduce bandwidth later on.
            Security: Can scan outbound traffic for threats.
            <section>
              Example use cases:
              Employees web traffic passes through a corporate proxy.
              A user hides their location by using an anonymising proxy or VPN like service.
              Schools restricting access to certain websites.
              Key Idea - A forward proxy represents a client

        Reverse proxy sits in front of servers, actung as a gateway for incoming requests form the internet, this works
        by Internet to Reverse Proxy to Backend Servers.
        <section>
          Primary Purposes
          Load Balancing: Distributes requests across multiple servers.
          Secuirty: Hide internal server details blocks malicious traffic.
          SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Termination: Offloads
        </section>
        <section>
          Examples
          Cloud platforms using reverse proxies to balance global traffic.
          Websites using NGINX/HAProxy as the entry point to backend applications.
          CDNs acting as reverse proxies close to users.
          Key Idea: A reverse proxy represents the server.

        Redundancy
        Means adding extra information (bits), extra paths, extra components.
        <section>
          Data Redundancy (Error Detection & Correction)
          Additional bit (parity bits, checksums, cyclic redundancy c, error correction codes) are added to transmitted
          data. (Flipped bits?)
          These extra bits allow the receiver to detect and sometimes correct errors without needing a retramission.
          Used in memory systems, storage, and some realtime communication where retramission is too slow or impossible.
          Talk about TCP, UDP, FEC (Forward error correction).
          <section>
            Path or Link Redundancy
            multiple links or routes between devices.
            If one path failes traffic automatically rerouted.
            Used in enterprise networks, data centers, and routing protocols OSPF, BGP, STP, VRRP, RIP.
          </section>
          <section>
            Hardware Redundancy
            Duplicate hardware components eg. dual power supplies, backup switches.
            Prevents single points to failure.
          </section>
          <section>
            Benefits
            Reduces down time.
            Improves reliability and fault tolerence.
            Allows error correction without

            Automatic retramissions
            Definition: Automatic retramission aka automatic repeat request or arq is a method where the receiver
            detects an error and requests the sender to resent the corrupted.
            <section>
              How it works
              Sender transmits data frames/packets.
              receiver checks the data usering error detection codes example crc.
              If an error is found, the receiver discards the frame and sends a negative acknowledgement NACK or simply stays silent.
              The sender retransmits the data.
            </section>
            <section>
              Common ARQ methods
              - Stop and Wait ARQ
              - Go Back N ARQ (N represents a number, similar to how coding uses X. So it means go back N frames)
              - Selective Repeat ARQ
              <section>
                Where ARQ is used
                - Transport layer protocols like TCP.
                - Wireless communication protocols.
                - Many reliable machine to machine communication systems
              </section>
              <section>
                Benefits of ARQ
                - Ensures high reliabilityin noisy or unpredictable networks
                - Straightforward and robust
                - Works without needing complex error-correcting codes

        <section>
          Summary
          - Redundancy adds extra data or alrernative Infrastructure to allow networks to detect, tolerate, or correct errors without needing to retransmit.
          - Automatic retramissions (ARQ) provide reliability by having the sender resend corrupted or missing data based on feedback from the receiver.
          - Both approaches are often used together to achieve end to end error control in modern networks.

        Parity check
        <p>
          Simple error detection method using one extra partiy bit. Can only sometimes detect the error.
          - Even parity: total number of 1s should be even.
          - Odd parity: total number of 1s should be odd.
          - Detects single bit error but cannot correct them.
        </p>
        <p>
          How it works
          Sender calculates parity bit from data bits
          - receiver recalculates parity and compares
          - Mismatch signals an error occurred
          - Cannot reliably detect multi-bit errors
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        CRC cyclic redundancy check
        <p>
          Stronger detection using polynomial division
          - Produces a checksum (look into what a checksum is) appended to data
          - Detects burst errors (multiple bit errors in clusters) more effectively than parity
          - Used in Ethernet, storage. compression formats
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        ECC (Error-Correcting Code)
        <p>
          advacned technique enabling correction of errors, unlike the other two this one might not even tell you about the error but might correct it anyway.
          - Adds mutliple redundant bits (Hamming, Reed-Solomon)
          - Used in ECC RAM, storage systems, telecoms
          - Can correct single or multiple bit errors depending on code
